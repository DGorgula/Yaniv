        <h1>Game Rules</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the game is to earn the fewest points in each
          round.<br />
          The player with the fewest points at the end of the game is the
          winner.<br />
          Each round in the game ends when a player declares "Yaniv!",<br />
          Each player's score is calculated from their remaining cards. <br />
          The player with the lowest score wins the round and receives no points
          for the round.<br />
          Other players record their corresponding scores for the round.
        </p>
        <h2>Play</h2>
        <p>
          The game proceeds clockwise. Since the starting player in each
          round<br />
          has an advantage, the starting player in the first chosen at
          random.<br />
          In subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round becomes the
          starting player.<br />
          Players have two options for their turn: <br />
          They may either play one or more cards or call "Yaniv!". <br />
          When playing cards, the player may discard a single card or a single
          set of cards, placing them into the discard pile.<br />
          The player must then draw a card from the draw pile.<br />
          Alternatively, the player may choose to take the card played by the
          previous player from the discard pile.<br />
          However, if the previous player played a multi-card set, only the
          first or the last card in the set may be chosen.<br />
          Note that the two jokers in the deck are taken into consideration.<br />
          If the drawing deck is empty and no one has yet called "Yaniv!", then
          all cards of the free stack,<br />
          excluding the last player's drop, are shuffled and placed face down as
          a new deck.
        </p>
        <h2>Sets</h2>
        <p>
          A player may discard any of the following sets of cards:<br />
          ➡ A single card<br />
          ➡ Two or more cards of the same rank<br />
          ➡ Three or more cards of consecutive ranks in the same suit.<br />
          ⚠ Note that aces are considered low for the purposes of sequences<br />
          ( an ace can be used before a 2, but not after a king)
        </p>
        <h2>Calling "Yaniv!"</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of their turn, instead of playing cards, a player may
          call "Yaniv!"<br />
          if their current score (the sum of all card values in the player's
          hand)<br />
          is less than 7.<br />
          When a player calls "Yaniv!," the round ends, and all players reveal
          their card totals.<br />
          If the player who called "Yaniv!" has the lowest card total, they
          score 0 points;<br />
          However, if another player has a total less than or equal to the
          calling player's total (a situation called "Asaf"),<br />
          the calling player scores points equal to their card total plus 30
          penalty points.<br />
          All other players, regardless of whether their card totals are lower
          than the calling player's total,<br />
          score points equal to their card totals. <br />
          The winner of the round is the player with the lowest card total.<br />
          They become the dealer and the starting player for the next round.
        </p>
        <h2>Ending the game</h2>
        <p>
          When a player's point total (the sum of the totals for each round)<br />
          crosses 200 points, that player is eliminated from the game.<br />
          Once all players but one have been eliminated, the remaining player is
          declared the winner.<br />
          There are two variations:<br />
          ➡ A certain limit is set. Whenever a player crosses that limit,<br />
          the game ends and the victor is the one with the smallest score.<br />
          ➡ A certain limit is set. Whenever a player crosses that limit,
          <br />they quit the game. The victor is the last remaining player.<br />
          The common limit is 200.
        </p>
        <h2>⚠ Important stuff! ⚠</h2>
        <p>
          When a player's score reaches above 200 points, he is out of the
          game.<br />
          If you reach exactly 200 points, your score is set back to 0.<br />
          When a player declares 'Yaniv!', but gets beaten by another
          player's<br />
          'Assaf!' call, he is then fined 30 points.
